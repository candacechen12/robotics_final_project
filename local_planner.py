# The purpose of the local_planner is to avoid obstacles that are not yet on the map.
# The exact behavior will depend on your implementation of the global planner;
# however, the local planner must act as a runtime monitor to monitor for
# imminent collisions and prevent them. You may implement this however you like,
# using what youâ€™ve learned from previous labs.
